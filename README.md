## Gem-Game

### Synopsis
***

A crystal collecting app I created that features dynamically updated HTML powered by Jquery code.  The app randomly picks a number from 19 to 120, then randomly assigns a number value from 1 to 12 to four different crystals.  The goal is to click the crystals in an amount and order to equal the main number without going over.  The app keeps track of your wins and losses, until you refresh or leave the page.
